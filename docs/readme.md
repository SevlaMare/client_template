# Technologies

### Front End Library

-Helps keeping the state in sincrony, and avoid the creation of a new framework
as the application grow, the choice here was react.

### Linters

-Base linters for JS projects: ESlint + Prettier + Stylelint, enforce a minimum
set of rules to make the code base more standard.

### Typescript

-Has features of quality of life for developing, like Type check while coding.

### Tailwind

-CSS library which can be used like bootstrap, but simple to customize, and
comes pre-setup to minify the bundle, also has a straightforward way to
implement themes.
